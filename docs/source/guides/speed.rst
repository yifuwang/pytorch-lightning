GPU/TPU training
****************

**Use when:** Whenever possible!

With Lightning, running on GPUs, TPUs or multiple node is a simple switch of a flag.

GPU training
============

Lightning supports a variety of plugins to further speed up distributed GPU training. Most notably:

* :class:`~pytorch_lightning.plugins.training_type.DDPPlugin`
* :class:`~pytorch_lightning.plugins.training_type.DDPShardedPlugin`
* :class:`~pytorch_lightning.plugins.training_type.DeepSpeedPlugin`

.. code-block:: python

    # run on 1 gpu
    trainer = Trainer(gpus=1)

    # train on 8 gpus, using DDP plugin
    trainer = Trainer(gpus=8, accelerator="ddp")

    # train on multiple GPUs across nodes (uses 8 gpus in total)
    trainer = Trainer(gpus=2, num_nodes=4)


GPU Training Speedup Tips
-------------------------

When training on single or multiple GPU machines, Lightning offers a host of advanced optimizations to improve throughput, memory efficiency, and model scaling.
Refer to :doc:`Advanced GPU Optimized Training for more details <../advanced/advanced_gpu>`.

Prefer DDP over DP
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:class:`~pytorch_lightning.plugins.training_type.DataParallelPlugin` performs three GPU transfers for EVERY batch:

1. Copy model to device.
2. Copy data to device.
3. Copy outputs of each device back to master.

Whereas :class:`~pytorch_lightning.plugins.training_type.DDPPlugin` only performs 1 transfer to sync gradients, making DDP MUCH faster than DP.


When using DDP plugins, set find_unused_parameters=False
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
By default we have set ``find_unused_parameters`` to True for compatibility reasons that have been observed in the past (see the `discussion <https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/discussions/6219>`_ for more details).
This by default comes with a performance hit, and can be disabled in most cases.

.. tip::
    It applies to all DDP plugins that support ``find_unused_parameters`` as input.

.. code-block:: python

    from pytorch_lightning.plugins import DDPPlugin

    trainer = pl.Trainer(
        gpus=2,
        plugins=DDPPlugin(find_unused_parameters=False),
    )

.. code-block:: python

    from pytorch_lightning.plugins import DDPSpawnPlugin

    trainer = pl.Trainer(
        gpus=2,
        plugins=DDPSpawnPlugin(find_unused_parameters=False),
    )

When using DDP on a multi-node cluster, set NCCL parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`NCCL <https://developer.nvidia.com/nccl>`__ is the NVIDIA Collective Communications Library which is used under the hood by PyTorch to handle communication across nodes and GPUs. There are reported benefits in terms of speedups when adjusting NCCL parameters as seen in this `issue <https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/issues/7179>`__. In the issue we see a 30% speed improvement when training the Transformer XLM-RoBERTa and a 15% improvement in training with Detectron2.

NCCL parameters can be adjusted via environment variables.

.. note::

    AWS and GCP already set default values for these on their clusters. This is typically useful for custom cluster setups.

* `NCCL_NSOCKS_PERTHREAD <https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/nccl/user-guide/docs/env.html#nccl-nsocks-perthread>`__
* `NCCL_SOCKET_NTHREADS <https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/nccl/user-guide/docs/env.html#nccl-socket-nthreads>`__
* `NCCL_MIN_NCHANNELS <https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/nccl/user-guide/docs/env.html#nccl-min-nchannels>`__

.. code-block:: bash

    export NCCL_NSOCKS_PERTHREAD=4
    export NCCL_SOCKET_NTHREADS=2

Dataloaders
^^^^^^^^^^^
When building your DataLoader set ``num_workers > 0`` and ``pin_memory=True`` (only for GPUs).

.. code-block:: python

    Dataloader(dataset, num_workers=8, pin_memory=True)

num_workers
"""""""""""

The question of how many workers to specify in ``num_workers`` is tricky. Here's a summary of
some references, [`1 <https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/guidelines-for-assigning-num-workers-to-dataloader/813>`_], and our suggestions:

1. ``num_workers=0`` means ONLY the main process will load batches (that can be a bottleneck).
2. ``num_workers=1`` means ONLY one worker (just not the main process) will load data but it will still be slow.
3. The ``num_workers`` depends on the batch size and your machine.
4. A general place to start is to set ``num_workers`` equal to the number of CPU cores on that machine. You can get the number of CPU cores in python using `os.cpu_count()`, but note that depending on your batch size, you may overflow RAM memory.

.. warning:: Increasing ``num_workers`` will ALSO increase your CPU memory consumption.

The best thing to do is to increase the ``num_workers`` slowly and stop once you see no more improvement in your training speed.

Spawn
"""""
When using ``accelerator=ddp_spawn`` or training on TPUs, the way multiple GPUs/TPU cores are used is by calling ``.spawn()`` under the hood.
The problem is that PyTorch has issues with ``num_workers > 0`` when using ``.spawn()``. For this reason we recommend you
use ``accelerator=ddp`` so you can increase the ``num_workers``, however your script has to be callable like so:

.. code-block:: bash

    python my_program.py


TPU training
============

You can set the ``tpu_cores`` trainer flag to 1 or 8 cores.

.. code-block:: python

    # train on 1 TPU core
    trainer = Trainer(tpu_cores=1)

    # train on 8 TPU cores
    trainer = Trainer(tpu_cores=8)

To train on more than 8 cores (ie: a POD),
submit this script using the xla_dist script.

Example::

    python -m torch_xla.distributed.xla_dist
    --tpu=$TPU_POD_NAME
    --conda-env=torch-xla-nightly
    --env=XLA_USE_BF16=1
    -- python your_trainer_file.py

*********************************
Mixed precision (16-bit) training
*********************************

**Use when:**

* You want to optimize for memory usage on a GPU.
* You have a GPU that supports 16 bit precision (NVIDIA pascal architecture or newer).
* Your optimization algorithm (training_step) is numerically stable.
* You want to be the cool person in the lab :p

Mixed precision combines the use of both 32 and 16 bit floating points to reduce memory footprint during model training, resulting in improved performance, achieving +3X speedups on modern GPUs.

Lightning offers mixed precision or 16-bit training for GPUs and TPUs.


.. testcode::
    :skipif: not _APEX_AVAILABLE and not _NATIVE_AMP_AVAILABLE or not torch.cuda.is_available()

    # 16-bit precision
    trainer = Trainer(precision=16, gpus=4)


----------------


***********************
Control Training Epochs
***********************

**Use when:** You run a hyperparameter search to find good initial parameters and want to save time, cost (money), or power (environment).
It can allow you to be more cost efficient and also run more experiments at the same time.

You can use Trainer flags to force training for a minimum number of epochs or limit to a max number of epochs. Use the `min_epochs` and `max_epochs` Trainer flags to set the number of epochs to run.

.. testcode::

    # DEFAULT
    trainer = Trainer(min_epochs=1, max_epochs=1000)


If running iteration based training, i.e. infinite / iterable dataloader, you can also control the number of steps with the `min_steps` and  `max_steps` flags:

.. testcode::

    trainer = Trainer(max_steps=1000)

    trainer = Trainer(min_steps=100)

You can also interupt training based on training time:

.. testcode::

    # Stop after 12 hours of training or when reaching 10 epochs (string)
    trainer = Trainer(max_time="00:12:00:00", max_epochs=10)

    # Stop after 1 day and 5 hours (dict)
    trainer = Trainer(max_time={"days": 1, "hours": 5})

Learn more in our :ref:`trainer_flags` guide.


----------------

****************************
Control Validation Frequency
****************************

Check validation every n epochs
===============================

**Use when:** You have a small dataset, and want to run less validation checks.

You can limit validation check to only run every n epochs using the `check_val_every_n_epoch` Trainer flag.

.. testcode::

    # DEFAULT
    trainer = Trainer(check_val_every_n_epoch=1)


Set validation check frequency within 1 training epoch
======================================================

**Use when:** You have a large training dataset, and want to run mid-epoch validation checks.

For large datasets, it's often desirable to check validation multiple times within a training loop.
Pass in a float to check that often within 1 training epoch. Pass in an int `k` to check every `k` training batches.
Must use an `int` if using an `IterableDataset`.

.. testcode::

    # DEFAULT
    trainer = Trainer(val_check_interval=0.95)

    # check every .25 of an epoch
    trainer = Trainer(val_check_interval=0.25)

    # check every 100 train batches (ie: for `IterableDatasets` or fixed frequency)
    trainer = Trainer(val_check_interval=100)

Learn more in our :ref:`trainer_flags` guide.

----------------

******************
Limit Dataset Size
******************

Use data subset for training, validation, and test
==================================================

**Use when:** Debugging or running huge datasets.

If you don't want to check 100% of the training/validation/test set set these flags:

.. testcode::

    # DEFAULT
    trainer = Trainer(limit_train_batches=1.0, limit_val_batches=1.0, limit_test_batches=1.0)

    # check 10%, 20%, 30% only, respectively for training, validation and test set
    trainer = Trainer(limit_train_batches=0.1, limit_val_batches=0.2, limit_test_batches=0.3)

If you also pass ``shuffle=True`` to the dataloader, a different random subset of your dataset will be used for each epoch; otherwise the same subset will be used for all epochs.

.. note:: ``limit_train_batches``, ``limit_val_batches`` and ``limit_test_batches`` will be overwritten by ``overfit_batches`` if ``overfit_batches`` > 0. ``limit_val_batches`` will be ignored if ``fast_dev_run=True``.

.. note:: If you set ``limit_val_batches=0``, validation will be disabled.

Learn more in our :ref:`trainer_flags` guide.

*********************
Preload Data Into RAM
*********************

**Use when:** You need access to all samples in a dataset at once.

When your training or preprocessing requires many operations to be performed on entire dataset(s), it can
sometimes be beneficial to store all data in RAM given there is enough space.
However, loading all data at the beginning of the training script has the disadvantage that it can take a long
time and hence it slows down the development process. Another downside is that in multiprocessing (e.g. DDP)
the data would get copied in each process.
One can overcome these problems by copying the data into RAM in advance.
Most UNIX-based operating systems provide direct access to tmpfs through a mount point typically named ``/dev/shm``.

0.  Increase shared memory if necessary. Refer to the documentation of your OS how to do this.

1.  Copy training data to shared memory:

    .. code-block:: bash

        cp -r /path/to/data/on/disk /dev/shm/

2.  Refer to the new data root in your script or command line arguments:

    .. code-block:: python

        datamodule = MyDataModule(data_root="/dev/shm/my_data")

---------

**************
Model Toggling
**************

**Use when:** Performing gradient accumulation with multiple optimizers in a
distributed setting.

Here is an explanation of what it does:

* Considering the current optimizer as A and all other optimizers as B.
* Toggling means that all parameters from B exclusive to A will have their ``requires_grad`` attribute set to ``False``.
* Their original state will be restored when exiting the context manager.

When performing gradient accumulation, there is no need to perform grad synchronization during the accumulation phase.
Setting ``sync_grad`` to ``False`` will block this synchronization and improve your training speed.

:class:`~pytorch_lightning.core.optimizer.LightningOptimizer` provides a
:meth:`~pytorch_lightning.core.optimizer.LightningOptimizer.toggle_model` function as a
:func:`contextlib.contextmanager` for advanced users.

Here is an example for advanced use-case:

.. testcode::

    # Scenario for a GAN with gradient accumulation every 2 batches and optimized for multiple gpus.
    class SimpleGAN(LightningModule):
        def __init__(self):
            super().__init__()
            self.automatic_optimization = False

        def training_step(self, batch, batch_idx):
            # Implementation follows the PyTorch tutorial:
            # https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/dcgan_faces_tutorial.html
            g_opt, d_opt = self.optimizers()

            X, _ = batch
            X.requires_grad = True
            batch_size = X.shape[0]

            real_label = torch.ones((batch_size, 1), device=self.device)
            fake_label = torch.zeros((batch_size, 1), device=self.device)

            # Sync and clear gradients
            # at the end of accumulation or
            # at the end of an epoch.
            is_last_batch_to_accumulate = (batch_idx + 1) % 2 == 0 or self.trainer.is_last_batch

            g_X = self.sample_G(batch_size)

            ##########################

            with d_opt.toggle_model(sync_grad=is_last_batch_to_accumulate):
                d_x = self.D(X)
                errD_real = self.criterion(d_x, real_label)

                d_z = self.D(g_X.detach())
                errD_fake = self.criterion(d_z, fake_label)

                errD = errD_real + errD_fake

                self.manual_backward(errD)
                if is_last_batch_to_accumulate:
                    d_opt.step()
                    d_opt.zero_grad()

                errG = self.criterion(d_z, real_label)

                self.manual_backward(errG)
                if is_last_batch_to_accumulate:
                    g_opt.step()

            self.log_dict({"g_loss": errG, "d_loss": errD}, prog_bar=True)

*****************
Set Grads to None
*****************

In order to modestly improve performance, you can override :meth:`~pytorch_lightning.core.lightning.LightningModule.optimizer_zero_grad`.

For a more detailed explanation of pros / cons of this technique,
read the documentation for :meth:`~torch.optim.Optimizer.zero_grad` by the PyTorch team.

.. testcode::

    class Model(LightningModule):
        def optimizer_zero_grad(self, epoch, batch_idx, optimizer, optimizer_idx):
            optimizer.zero_grad(set_to_none=True)


-----

***************
Things to avoid
***************

.item(), .numpy(), .cpu()
=========================
Don't call ``.item()`` anywhere in your code. Use ``.detach()`` instead to remove the connected graph calls. Lightning
takes a great deal of care to be optimized for this.

----------

empty_cache()
=============
Don't call this unnecessarily! Every time you call this ALL your GPUs have to wait to sync.

----------

Tranfering tensors to device
============================
LightningModules know what device they are on! Construct tensors on the device directly to avoid CPU->Device transfer.

.. code-block:: python

    # bad
    t = torch.rand(2, 2).cuda()

    # good (self is LightningModule)
    t = torch.rand(2, 2, device=self.device)


For tensors that need to be model attributes, it is best practice to register them as buffers in the modules's
``__init__`` method:

.. code-block:: python

    # bad
    self.t = torch.rand(2, 2, device=self.device)

    # good
    self.register_buffer("t", torch.rand(2, 2))
